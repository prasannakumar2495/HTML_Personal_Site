        The full form of HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is basically the skeleton of a website. HTML will be
        used to decide the structure of a website using a series of elements. We can create a website just wait just by
        using HTML but we cannot create a website just by using CSS for JavaScript. While creating a website HTML is
        mandatory.
    </p> <br>
    There are so many tag elements in HTML (most of the HTML tag elements have closing except few). Few of them are as
    follows:
    <ul>
        <li>h1 - This is the heading tag element, this is the first one in the series of heading tag elements and size
            of this tag element is the biggest of all the heading tags elements.</li>
        <li>br - This element is used to provide space Between different tag elements. This tiger man does not have a
            closing.</li>
        <li>strong - Any word or sentence that is written in between this tag element will be displayed in bold
            showcasing that this is an important sentence.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <pre>
        The tag elements also consist of many attributes that are written within them which are usually defined use to
        define the style and various other properties.
        While writing the HTML code the programmer can write comments in between the "but this comment will not be
        displayed in the website.
        Example:
        <!--
            Anything that is written in between these lines will not be displayed in the code, but can be seen in the source code.
        -->
    </pre>
    <ul>
        Few of the attribute elements are as follows:
        <li>style - This attribute is used to specify the font style, size and various other features of a particular
            tag within HTML file.</li>
        <li>align - This attribute is used to specify how a particular tag element should be aligned.</li>

        Example:
        <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">This is a text.</p>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        The full form of CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. This is used for styling the HTML elements internally within the
        HTML file or we can also create an external CSS file and we can assign the styles globally to a bulk of HTML
        files at a shot.
    </p>
    <pre>
        Example: Assigning styles to multiple tag elements from a common external CSS file can be done as follows:

        body{
            background-color: cornsilk;
        }
        hr{
            border-style: dotted;
          }
          p{
            font-style: normal;
            font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
          }
    </pre>
    <p>
        Once the external style sheet has been completed the user can link that particular external style sheet to all
        the HTML files by using a tag element called as link.

        Example:
        link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS/stylesheet.css"
    </p>
